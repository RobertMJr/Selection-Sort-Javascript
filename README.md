### Description
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input. It performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array.
 Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists.

    - A sorting algorithm similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.
